```{r}

#install BiocManager if needed
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

#install GSVA if necessary
if (!requireNamespace( "GSVA" , quietly = TRUE)) 
    BiocManager::install("GSVA")

library(tidyverse)
library("GSVA")
```


Outline:
  1. Load in the Catenin signature information created from differential gene expression analysis
  2. Load in CTRP RNA-Seq data
  3. Format and perform GSVA to score each CTRP cell line 
  4. Load in the PARP inhibitor and Drug inhibitor information 
  5. Perform correlation analysis between GSVA signature scores and Drug Inhibitor
